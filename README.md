# EntropyFusion
FusedEntropy is a multi-source entropy generator that collects randomness from user input, mouse movements, webcam images, and microphone audio. By combining these diverse inputs, it produces a highly unpredictable and secure random value â€” ideal for cryptographic applications or secure seed generation.
